# Adidas USA Sales Data Dashboard Project

## Project Overview
This project involves the creation of a comprehensive Sales Dashboard for Adidas USA based on sales data, leveraging Power BI for data cleaning, transformation, and visualization. The dataset provided includes various sales and product information, such as total sales, operating profit, and units sold across multiple regions and product categories.

The objective of the project was to create interactive and insightful visualizations that offer valuable business insights for decision-making and performance evaluation. The data was cleaned and transformed using Power Query Editor and enhanced with DAX Functions to calculate key performance indicators (KPIs) and provide meaningful insights.
